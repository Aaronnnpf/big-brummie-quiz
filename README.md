Identifies what kind of page it is, In this case a Quiz.

## Wireframes
All wireframes were created using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) 

I went slightly off script to my wireframes to include and intro paragraph where the heading was originally going to go, so that i could expand alittle futher on the page as to why I decided to choose Birmingham as the topic and also give some information in regards to the city I call home, By doing this is it also ment moving the heading of the page up on top of the hero image.

![contrast]( "contrast")
* The disabled function for my buttons does not work as intended.
* The intro paragraph does not reappear unless the page is refreshed.

### Fixed bugs

* Changed hero image to allow for a better contrast between color and image on top the page.
* The end of the quiz showed "wrong answer Try again" message when the quiz was over. 
* Hero image would zoom all the way in on smaller screen sizes.
* The font size for the boxes was too big causing it to flow out of the answer boxes.

* Returning user goals

1. As a returning user, I want to see if i can increase my score and show I have learnt more.
* There is a score keeper built into the quiz to show how many questions have bee nanswered correctly, Although the engine itself is a "correct only continuation" I have placed what I believe to be a competitive timer. 

![Score](https://github.com/Aaronnnpf/big-brummie-quiz/blob/main/docs/readme/score-timer.png "Score")

2. As a returning user, I want to expand upon my knowledge of the city.
* The quiz itself features sites and areas all within the city itself allowing for the user to become intrigued about the other areas or sites mentioned.

3. As a returning user, I want to enjoy the quiz and keep it as user friendly as possible.
* The quiz is easily accessible. The page is clear and uncluttered, and answers are distinctly colour-coded. The quiz presents a blanced mix of general knowledge and local knowledge questions. Both types promote knowledge acquisition and an enjoyable learning experience.

1. As a frequent user, I want to be able to test myself, friends and family and be able to compare scores.
