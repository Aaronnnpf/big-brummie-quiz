Identifies what kind of page it is, In this case a Quiz.

## Wireframes
All wireframes were created using [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) 

I went slightly off script to my wireframes to include and intro paragraph where the heading was originally going to go, so that i could expand alittle futher on the page as to why I decided to choose Birmingham as the topic and also give some information in regards to the city I call home, By doing this is it also ment moving the heading of the page up on top of the hero image.
